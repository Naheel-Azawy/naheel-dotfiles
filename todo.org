  FIxed. It was ~tlp~ all along.

  First run this command:

  [nikola@leviathan ~]$ lsusb
  Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
  Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:b721 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
  Bus 001 Device 002: ID 04f2:b483 Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd
  Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
  Get the ID of the bluetooth device (in my case it is Realtek, so the ID is 0bda:b721).

  Now, change the line #USB_BLACKLIST="1111:2222 3333:4444" to USB_BLACKLIST="<ID>" (in my case to USB_BLACKLIST="0bda:b721") in /etc/default/tlp.

  Reboot and everything should work.

  Credits go to Aditya.
